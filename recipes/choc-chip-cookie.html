        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I'll get straight to the point and avoid boring you with a long story that you have to scroll miles to get past. This is my favorite brown butter chocolate chip cookie recipe.</p>
        <p>You're going to have to guess the ingredient amounts, though, since I don't remember them. Anyway baking is all about gut feel over exact measurements, right?</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>227g butter</li>
            <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>250g lightly dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>190g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>127g bread flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>chocolate bar, chopped</li>
            <li>hazelnuts, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter. Swirling the pan occasionally, continue to cook the butter. It should become foamy with audible cracking and popping noises. Once the crackling stops continue to swirl the pan until the butter develops a nutty aroma and brown bits start to form at the bottom. Once the bits are amber in color, about 2 to 3 minutes after the popping stops, remove from heat and pour into a mixing bowl. Add in the sugars, stir, then set aside to cool completely.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl combine the flours, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>To the browned butter mixture, add the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla and stir with a rubber spatula until combined. Slowly stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and wafers.</li>
            <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. Let dough sit at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350ÂºF. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls and drop onto prepared baking sheets, leaving about 3 inches between each piece of dough to spread.</li>
            <li>Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
