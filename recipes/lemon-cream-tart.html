        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I'll get straight to the point and avoid boring you with a long story that you have to scroll miles to get past. This is my favorite lemon cream tart recipe from Tartine Bakery. The lemon curd is velvety and luscious, with the perfect flavor of tart Meyer lemon. When paired with a dollop of whipped cream, it's heaven!</p>
        <p>You're going to have to guess the ingredient amounts, though, since I don't remember them. Anyway baking is all about gut feel over exact measurements, right?</p>
